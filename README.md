## Chart of Language
| Languages I Use | Ranking/10 | Desc   |
| --------        | -------- | -------- |
| Python          | 7/10     | I've learned many use cases for Python, and if I need to use it I can implement it in my code as needed. |
| Java            | 6/10     | Not my preferred OOP language, but it has access to a lot of neat tools. |
| IBM Assembly    | 8/10     | Of the low level languages out there, this takes the cake for how easy it is to understand. It only operates on the IBM mainframe, however, which makes it lose points for me. |
| nasm            | 7/10     | I'm still learning this one, so my score may go up with time. Recently programmed a proto-operating system with this. |
| C               | 9/10     | Versatile and verbose enough for me to use *exactly* what I need and not obfuscate anything. Great for when I just need to program a simple idea or to work with registers |
| C++             | 10/10    | My favorite language. Essentially C, but with more features for more mainstream use - and easy to compile! |
| C#              | 9/10     | Surprisingly versatile and with an easy-to-understand syntax, great for my console applications. |
| Visual Basic    | 6/10     | Way too much boilerplate. It's only saving grace is the visual editor in Visual Studio being incredibly simple. |
