## Goals:
- Be the best ~~vice~~ president ACM has seen
- Make an impact
- Design an x86 operating system for my personal uses
- Program a (*better*) compiler 
 - Work on my programming language a little more

## Skills!
- C/C++ programmer
- Avid Arduino programmer and circuit board designer
- Vim user
- Capable of navigating an EFI system to boot into Linux (Arch, Kali, etc.) and familiar with many Linux commands
- Specialized in Microsoft Office tools as well as Markdown
- Frequent user of SDL
- Adept at learning low-level and object-oriented programming

## Recent Projects (sorted by latest to earliest)
- Bash script to display percentage used of both RAM and swap
- SQLite database written in C for my Software Engineering course project
- Custom Game Engine in SDL
- My Own Procedural Language
- Visual Basic applications for my GUI class
- [Number Format Game for ACM](https://github.com/aceofdiamonds4500/Nicks-Arduino-Code/tree/main/NumberFormatGame)

## Chart of Language
| Languages I Use | Ranking/10 | Desc   |
| --------        | -------- | -------- |
| Python          | 7/10     | I've learned many use cases for Python, and if I need to use it I can implement it in my code as needed. |
| Haskell         | 9/10     | While the syntax is incredibly foreign, I had a splendid time playing around with the interpreter - it has made my algorithm analysis class easier. |
| Java            | 6/10     | Not my preferred OOP language, but it has access to a lot of neat tools. |
| IBM Assembly    | 8/10     | Of the low level languages out there, this takes the cake for how easy it is to understand. Exclusive to the IBM Mainframe which I may never use (IBM hire me). |
| nasm            | 7/10     | I'm still learning this one, so my score may go up with time. Recently programmed a proto-operating system with this. |
| C               | 9/10     | Versatile and verbose enough for me to use *exactly* what I need and not obfuscate anything. Great for when I just need to program a simple idea or to work with registers |
| C++             | 10/10    | My favorite language. Essentially C, but with more features for more mainstream use - and easy to compile! |
| C#              | 9/10     | Surprisingly versatile and with an easy-to-understand syntax, great for my console applications. Bjarne accurately predicted I would blow my whole leg off, though. |
| Visual Basic    | 6/10     | Way too much boilerplate. It's only saving grace is the visual editor in Visual Studio being incredibly simple. |
